            If we actively aggregate personal data at the individual level and
            selectively allow developers privacy-preserving access to its
            contents, our data becomes capital in the production of machine
            learning technology. Individuals get returns to their "personal data
            investments" in the form of increased access to and control over the
            emerged artificial intelligence.
